# Vertrical Challenge

After cloning the repository, please follow these steps:

## Step 1: Run the back-end of the project.

In vertrical/back-end, open a terminal and type `npm install` to install the dependencies.
After that, run `npm run start` or `npm run dev`.

By default, the application server will be running on port 8080. If you need to change the port, go to the `.env` file and change the value of the PORT variable.

## Step 2: Run the front-end of the project.

As before, in the directory vertrical/front-end, open a terminal and type `npm install` to install the dependencies.
After that, run `npm run start`.

When it's ready, the front-end of the application will open in a new tab of your default browser, in the direction `http://localhost:3000/`.
